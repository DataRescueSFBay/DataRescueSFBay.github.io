# Where

Berkeley Institute for Data Science, inside Doe Memorial Library on UC Berkeley campus.

It's easiest to enter through the north entrance of Doe, on Memorial Glade. BIDS will be immediately to your left, in room 190. If you need step-free access, please enter on the south side of Doe, behind Wheeler Hall and South Hall. A floorplan of Doe and BIDS can be found [here](http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/doe-floorplan-1.pdf).
