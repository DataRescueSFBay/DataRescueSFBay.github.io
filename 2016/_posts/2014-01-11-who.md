DataRescue SF Bay 2017 is part of the [DataRefuge project](http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge), in partnership with the [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI)](https://envirodatagov.org/) and the [End of Term Presidential Harvest from the Internet Archive](http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/). We're grateful to [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/) for providing space.

Outside the SF Bay Area? Check [here](https://envirodatagov.org/events/) and [here](http://www.ppehlab.org/datarescue-events) for sister events in your area.

Want to volunteer, sponsor the event, or host a parallel event elsewhere in the Bay? We'd love to hear from you!
