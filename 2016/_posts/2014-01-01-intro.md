# DataRescue SF Bay
![logo](https://github.com/DataRescueSFBay/DataRescueSFBay.github.io/raw/master/img/datarefuge-sfbay-logo.jpg)

Care about science, data, or the environment? Join us for a day of guerrilla archiving in response to the Trump presidency.

\#DataRescueSFBay is an opportunity for civic hackers, scientists, activists, and volunteers of all kinds to identify, back-up, and help preserve at-risk climate and environmental data resources before they are suppressed from public view and use.

The incoming administration has communicated its attitude of climate change denial and its antagonism toward the scientists, researchers, and civil servants who study it and inform the public of its causes and effects. We seek to sustain the progress studying and responding to this existential crisis by protecting vital scientific resources from suppression---archiving them in multiple, redundant repositories so they may be accessed and reused after potentially disappearing from federal government websites.

# When?
Saturday, February 11th, 9am-5pm

# Where?
Berkeley Institute for Data Science, at 190 Doe Library in Berkeley, CA
