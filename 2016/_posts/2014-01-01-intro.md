# DataRescue SF Bay

## Feb 11 2017 at UC Berkeley

**\#DataRescueSFBay** is an opportunity for civic hackers, scientists, activists, and volunteers of all kinds to identify, back-up, and help preserve at-risk climate and environmental data resources before they are suppressed from public view and use.

Join us for a day of guerrilla archiving in response to the Trump presidency.
