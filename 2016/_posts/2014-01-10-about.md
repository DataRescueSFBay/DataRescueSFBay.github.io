# About Us

DataRescue SF Bay 2017 is part of the [DataRefuge project](http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge), in collaboration with the [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI)](https://envirodatagov.org/) and the [End of Term Presidential Harvest from the Internet Archive](http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/). We're grateful to [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/) for providing space.
