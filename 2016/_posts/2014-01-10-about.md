# About Us

The incoming administration has communicated its attitude of climate change denial and its antagonism toward the scientists, researchers, and civil servants who study it and inform the public of its causes and effects. We seek to protect vital scientific resources from suppression---archiving them in multiple, redundant repositories so they may be accessed and reused after potentially disappearing from federal government websites.

DataRescue SF Bay 2017 is part of the [DataRefuge project](http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge), in partnership with the [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI)](https://envirodatagov.org/) and the [End of Term Presidential Harvest from the Internet Archive](http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/). We're grateful to [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/) for providing space.
